🖼️ AI Image Compressor (Frontend Prototype)

A simple image compression web app that lets you upload an image, compress it at different quality levels (25%, 50%, 75%, 90%), and download the compressed result.

⚡ Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Canvas API).
🚀 Future plan: integrate AI-powered K-Means clustering for smarter compression.

🔥 Features

Upload JPG/PNG images.

Preview original vs compressed images.
See size reduction, compression ratio, % savings.
Choose compression quality (25%, 50%, 75%, 90%).
Download compressed image.
Responsive, modern UI.
